# daily-vim

Daily Vim is a project I created to help with my own Vim journey. The idea is to
break it down in bite-sized chunk so you can learn one command or productivity
trick at a time.

Each day, you'll find a new Vim tip or trick that I've discovered and found
useful in my own coding. Some days it will be a simple command, other days a
productivity hack. But it will always be something small, you can immediately
apply to your own Vim usage.
